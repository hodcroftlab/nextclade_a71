## Scope of this dataset

This dataset uses the historical BrCr reference sequence ([U22521.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U22521)), which may differ from contemporary global EV-A71 strains. It is intended for broad genogroup classification, mutation quality control, and phylogenetic analysis of EV-A71 diversity.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Genogroup assignment (A–G) based on phylogenetic structure
- Nucleotide-level QC and mutation detection
- Alignment to reference and tree placement
- Support for full genome and VP1 sequences

## Genogroups of Enterovirus A71

The genogroups A through G represent major phylogenetic divisions within EV-A71, commonly used in virological surveillance and literature. These are defined by phylogenetic clustering and do not necessarily indicate antigenic differences.

No standardized global lineage system is currently maintained, so group naming follows historical and regional convention.

## What is a Nextclade dataset?

A Nextclade dataset includes the reference sequence, gene annotations, a phylogenetic tree, and QC configuration. Learn more in the [Nextclade documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html).
