## Scope of this dataset

This dataset uses the historical BrCr reference sequence ([U22521.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U22521)), which may differ from contemporary global EV-A71 strains. It is intended for broad subgenogroup classification, mutation quality control, and phylogenetic analysis of EV-A71 diversity.

## Features

This dataset supports:

- Assignment of subgenotypes
- Phylogenetic placement
- Sequence quality control (QC)

## Subgenogroups of Enterovirus A71

The genogroups A through G represent major phylogenetic divisions within EV-A71, commonly used in virological surveillance and literature. These are defined by phylogenetic clustering and do not necessarily indicate antigenic differences.

No standardized global lineage system is currently maintained, so subgenogroup naming follows historical and regional convention.

## What is a Nextclade dataset?

A Nextclade dataset includes the reference sequence, gene annotations, a phylogenetic tree, and QC configuration. Learn more in the [Nextclade documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/datasets.html).
